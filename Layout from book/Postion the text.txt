for top and bottom 50 px 70 px

top bottom 
left right 

Fixed Positioning
position:fixe
It positions the element in 
relation to the browser window. 
Therefore, when a user scrolls 
down the page, it stays in the 
exact same place. It is a good 
idea to try this example in your 
browser to see the effect

this example, the heading 
has been positioned to the top 
left hand corner of the browser 
window. When the user scrolls 
down the page, the paragraphs 
disappear behind the heading

chapter-15/z-index.html CSS When you use relative, fixed, or 
absolute positioning, boxes can 
overlap. If boxes do overlap, the 
elements that appear later in the 
HTML code sit on top of those 
that are earlier in the page. 
If you want to control which 
element sits on top, you can use 
the z-index property. Its value 
is a number, and the higher the 
number the closer that element 
is to the front. For example, an 
element with a z-index of 10
will appear over the top of one 
with a z-index of 5.
This example looks similar to 
the one on page 368, but it 
uses relative positioning for 
the <p> elements. Because 
the paragraphs are relatively 
positioned, by default they 
would appear over the top of the 
heading as the user scrolls down 
the page. To ensure that the 
<h1> element stays on top, we 
use the z-index property on the 
rule for the <h1> element.
The z-index is sometimes 
referred to as the stacking 
context (as if the blocks have 
been stacked on top of each 
other on a z axis). If you are 
familiar with desktop publishing 
packages, it is the equivalent 
of using the 'bring to front' and 
'send to back' features.

Floating Elements
float

the float property allows you 
to take an element in normal 
flow and place it as far to the 
left or right of the containing 
element as possible.

When you use the float
property, you should also use the 
width property to indicate how 
wide the floated element should 
be. If you do not, results can be 
inconsistent but the box is likely 
to take up the full width of the 
containing element (just like it 
would in normal 


in this example, a 
<blockquote> element is 
used to hold a quotation. It's 
containing element is the 
<body> element
