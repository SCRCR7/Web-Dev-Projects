Fixed Positioning
position:fixe
It positions the element in 
relation to the browser window. 
Therefore, when a user scrolls 
down the page, it stays in the 
exact same place. It is a good 
idea to try this example in your 
browser to see the effect

this example, the heading 
has been positioned to the top 
left hand corner of the browser 
window. When the user scrolls 
down the page, the paragraphs 
disappear behind the heading
